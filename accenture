Password – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

You are given a task in your college group project to add validation in the password fields of a form.
The form has three fields: First Name, Password, and Re-type Password.
Your task is to complete the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to implement the following objectives:

Objectives:

Create a button with id = "Submit" that will call the passwordformValidation() function when clicked on it.

Give a border-radius of 5px to all the input tags.

First Name is to be made a mandatory field.
If the field remains empty, the HTML content of the paragraph tag with id = "demo" should be updated with the message:
"First Name has to be entered".

Your project requires to check values of Password and Re-type Password fields to be exactly same.
In case the values differ, then the message "Passwords do not match" should be displayed inside the paragraph tag with id = "demo"`.

The request in the image is to complete a Profile Page for a user to update their name and email, with three specific objectives:

Button Content: Add the text "Save Changes" to the button with the ID saveBtn.

Button Styling:

Set the background color of the button with ID saveBtn to #28a745.

Set the font-size of the button text to 18px.

JavaScript Validation:

Add JavaScript validation to check if the name entered in the input field has a minimum of 3 characters.

If the validation fails (the name is less than 3 characters), display the message "Name must be at least 3 characters long" in the span with the ID nameError.

The image outlines the task of creating a simple Shopping Cart web application and specifies three objectives to complete the task:

Create Add to Cart Buttons: Create an "Add to Cart" button for every item (Chips, Soda, and Cookies) in the Items Table under the "Action" Column. These buttons must have the unique IDs: addToCartChips, addToCartSoda, and addToCartCookies respectively.

Style Tables: Give both tables (presumably the Items Table and the Shopping Cart Table) a border color of #0056b3.

Implement JavaScript Logic: Complete the JavaScript code to update the quantity of each item in the Shopping Cart Table whenever its respective Add to Cart button is clicked.
--------------------------
Create 3 buttons labeled:

Primary

Accent

Ghost

Each button should have a distinct color theme:

Primary → Blue tone

Accent → Orange or red tone

Ghost → Transparent with border (subtle style)

On click, each button should change the website’s theme color to match its style.

Example: Clicking Primary makes the page blue-themed,
Clicking Accent makes it orange-themed,
Clicking Ghost resets or applies a neutral theme.

Use CSS variables or classes to control the theme colors dynamically.

The buttons should look modern — rounded corners, smooth hover transitions, and possibly slight shadows or gradients.
